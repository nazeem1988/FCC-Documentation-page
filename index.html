                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                    first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                    non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript
                    is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
                    declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>
                <code>var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
                            myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';</code>
                <p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to
                    Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs specific to Web pages, please see
                    Web APIs and DOM.</p>
                <code>var myVariable;</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support
                        ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA
                        International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called
                        ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript
                        standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version,
                        which is currently ECMAScript 2020.</li>
                    <li>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
                        trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
                        programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.</li>

                <p>Head over to our Learning Area JavaScript topic if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous
                    experience of JavaScript or programming. The complete modules available there are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript first steps</li>
                    <p>Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and
                        "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings,
                        numbers, and arrays.</p>
                    <li>JavaScript building blocks</li>
                    <p>Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to
                        commonly-encountered types of code block such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and
                        events.</p>
                    <code>var myVariable = 'Bob';
                            myVariable = 'Steve';</code>
                    <li>Introducing JavaScript objects</li>
                    <p>The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further
                        with
                        your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this
                        module
                        to help you.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side web APIs</li>
                    <p>When writing client-side JavaScript for web sites or applications, you won't go very far before
                        you
                        start to use APIs â€” interfaces for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating
                        system the site is running on, or even data from other web sites or services. In this module we
                        will
                        explore what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in
                        your
                        development work. </p>
                    <li>A re-introduction to JavaScript</li>
                    <p>An overview for those who think they know about JavaScript.</p>
                    <code>Math.sin(3.5);
                        var circumference = 2 * Math.PI * r;</code>
                    <li>JavaScript data structures</li>
                    <p>Overview of available data structures in JavaScript.</p>
                    <code>parseInt('123', 10); // 123
                        parseInt('010', 10); // 10</code>
                    <li>Equality comparisons and sameness</li>
                    <p>JavaScript provides three different value-comparison operations: strict equality using ===, loose
                        equality using ==, and the Object.is() method.</p>
                    <li>Closures</li>
                    <p>A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function
                        was
                        declared.</p>

                    <p>Explanation of the widely misunderstood and under-estimated prototype-based inheritance.</p>
                    <li>Strict mode</li>
                    <p>Strict mode defines that you can not use any variable before initializing it. It is a restricted
                        variant of ECMAScript 5, for faster performance and easier debugging.</p>
                    <li>JavaScript typed arrays</li>
                    <p>JavaScript typed arrays provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data.</p>

                    <li>Concurrency model and Event Loop</li>
                    <p>JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an "event loop".</p>
